# iOS Mouse and Keyboard Events Library

This repository contains the Objective-C scripts and Xcode project for an iOS library that captures mouse and keyboard events using Appleâ€™s GCMouse and GCKeyboard frameworks. The library provides a bridge to Unity, enabling developers to integrate mouse and keyboard interactions in their Unity applications on iOS.

Check out the [Unity iOS Input Events Bridge repository](https://github.com/manaporkun/unity-ios-input-plugin/tree/main) for the Unity project that integrates with this library to translate native iOS events into Unity events.
